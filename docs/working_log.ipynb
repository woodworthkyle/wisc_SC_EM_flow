    "Reading through this thesis: https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/61254/701906470-MIT.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\n",

    "The gist of it is that we need to assign surface impedance to the boundaries of a metal so that the simulator doesn't have to solve for the inside of the metal. The idea being that assigning a sheet impedance imposes a boundary condition for the solver.\n",
    "- The technical derivations involve treating an incident wave problem as an impedance mismatch problem (ie transmission line problem)\n",
    "- In \"Transmission Lines for Digital and Communication Networks\" by Matick it is argued that parallel propagation of a wave (along a conductor) yields the same solutions and surface impedance as that of a normally incident wave.\n",
    "- Additional derivations are included in: https://library.nrao.edu/public/memos/alma/memo245.pdf\n",
    "- they go into deriving the surface impedance of a thick conductor\n",
    "$$Z_s = (1+j)\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega \\mu}{2 \\sigma}}$$\n",
    "- they then show the derivation of a finite thickness conductor (Infinitesimally thin)\n",
    "$$Z_S = \\frac{k}{\\sigma}\\left[ \\frac{e^{kt} + \\frac{\\sigma Z_{\\eta} - k}{\\sigma Z_{\\eta} + k}e^{-kt}}{e^{kt} - \\frac{\\sigma Z_{\\eta} - k}{\\sigma Z_{\\eta} + k}e^{-kt}} \\right]$$\n",
    "where, \n",
    "$$k = \\frac{1+j}{\\delta}$$\n",
    "and simplifies to \n",
    "$$Z_s = \\frac{k}{\\sigma}\\left[ \\frac{e^{kt} + e^{-kt}}{e^{kt} - e^{-kt}} \\right] = \\frac{k}{\\sigma}coth(kt)$$\n",
    "when $Z_{\\eta}$ is the impedance of free space and frequencies of interest are in the gigahertz regime.\n",
    "- Great, but how does this actually translate to an EM solve like HFSS? We basically can model a conductor with finite thickness as 2 infinitesimally thin sheets in parallel. \n",
    "$$Z_x = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (2Z_S - j\\omega L_t) \\pm  [4Z_s^2 + (j\\omega L_t)^2]^{1/2}\\right]$$\n",
    "where \n",
    "$$L_t = \\frac{Z_{\\eta}tan(\\beta t)}{\\omega}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\beta = \\omega \\sqrt{{\\mu}_0 {\\epsilon}_0} = \\frac{\\omega}{c} = \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $Z_s$ is the surface impedance calculated above...I think.\n",
    "- Something strange starts to happen when a conductor is stimulated by very high frequencies and/or subject to low temperatures\n",
    "- We need to be careful of conductors that are thin \n"
